<p>The maintainers will now be given few privileges, handing them full control over to Jenkins to initiate a test build anytime so that there will be more preliminary checks done before the official releases.</p>

<p>We are also looking forward in seeing more active contributors, which will open the opportunity for them to become a part of Core Team. Our doors are now wide open for all contributors. The criteria to get into ArrowOS Squad will be judged upon how useful and error-free those contributions are to the project keeping in mind maintaining code integrity and ownerships to those commits respectively.</p>
